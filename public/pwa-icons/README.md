# PWA Icons Setup Instructions

To complete the PWA setup, you need to create the following icon files in this directory:

## Required Icon Sizes
- icon-72x72.png (72x72 pixels)
- icon-96x96.png (96x96 pixels)
- icon-128x128.png (128x128 pixels)
- icon-144x144.png (144x144 pixels)
- icon-152x152.png (152x152 pixels)
- icon-192x192.png (192x192 pixels)
- icon-384x384.png (384x384 pixels)
- icon-512x512.png (512x512 pixels)

## How to Create Icons
1. Create a square image (at least 512x512 pixels recommended) with your app logo/icon
2. Use an online tool like https://www.favicon-generator.org/ or https://realfavicongenerator.net/
3. Or use a graphics editor to resize your image to each required dimension
4. Save each size with the corresponding filename in this directory

## Recommended Design
- Use a simple, recognizable icon that represents your app
- Ensure it's visible and clear at small sizes (72x72)
- Consider using your app's primary colors
- Make sure it contrasts well on both light and dark backgrounds
